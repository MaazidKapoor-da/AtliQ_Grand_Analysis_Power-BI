# AtliQ_Grand_Analysis_Power-BI

## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## Insights
-  **ADR Stability:** The Average Daily Rate (ADR) has remained steady, indicating a consistent pricing strategy. However, there's an opportunity to implement dynamic pricing based on weekdays and weekends to optimize revenue by aligning rates with demand fluctuations.
- **Occupancy Rate:** AtliQ Grands' properties have a healthy occupancy rate of 57%, indicating effective room utilization. Strategies to further increase occupancy, especially during off-peak periods, could enhance revenue potential.
- **Average Rating:** Guest satisfaction, reflected in an average rating of 3.62, highlights the positive guest experience provided by AtliQ Grands. Maintaining and improving this rating through exceptional service and addressing guest feedback is crucial for continued success.

## Suggestions

- **Enhance Occupancy Rates:** Focus on strategies to increase occupancy rates to boost revenue.
- **Utilize Late Bookings and Extended Stays:** Take advantage of late bookings and encourage guests to extend their stays to generate additional revenue.
- **Maximize Weekend Occupancy:** Aim to maintain maximum occupancy percentages, particularly on weekends, to optimize revenue.
- **Platform Focus:** Identify and prioritize platforms where bookings are lower and focus on increasing visibility and bookings through those channels.
- **Improve Average Ratings:** Address issues causing low ratings in certain hotels to improve overall guest satisfaction and engagement, aiming for an average rating between 3.65 and 3.6.
- **Address Low-Rated Locations:** Specifically target cities with ratings below 3 by understanding and addressing the reasons behind low ratings to improve occupancy rates. 
- **Implement Dynamic Pricing:** Introduce a dynamic pricing strategy and offer coupons and cashback incentives to customers booking directly through the hotel's website or offline, thus increasing revenue realization.
